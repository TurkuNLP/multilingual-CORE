# Multilingual CORE

This repository contains a collection of web-crawled documents annotated with a hierarchical register scheme based on the CORE taxonomy, originally developed for English by Biber and Egbert ([2018](https://doi.org/10.1017/9781316388228)) and Laippala et al. ([2022](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10579-022-09624-1)). This scheme has been applied to **16 languages**, with five large subcorpora (English, Finnish, French, Swedish, Turkish) and eleven smaller ones (Arabic, Catalan, Spanish, Persian, Hindi, Indonesian, Japanese, Norwegian, Portuguese, Urdu, Chinese).

The data in this repository was used to train our **multilingual register classifier**, available on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/TurkuNLP/web-register-classification-multilingual).
